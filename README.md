# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## iOS: modular headers flag

This project enables CocoaPods `use_modular_headers!` conditionally to allow some Swift-based Firebase pods to import Objective-C dependencies that don't ship module maps (for example, `GoogleUtilities`).

- Controlled by the repository property: `ios.useModularHeaders` in `ios/Podfile.properties.json` (set to `"true"` to enable).
- Alternatively, set the environment variable `USE_MODULAR_HEADERS=1` when running `pod install` or CI to enable it per-machine.

If you'd rather enable modular headers only for specific pods, remove the repository flag and add `:modular_headers => true` to those pod declarations in `ios/Podfile`.
